# FDDA_SOH_estimation

A full probability deep domain adaptation method for SOH estimation: "Ma et al. Estimating the State of Health for Lithium-ion Batteries: A Particle Swarm Optimization-Assisted Deep Domain Adaptation Approach"

The file "SOH estimation.ipynb" based on Jupyter Notebook is used for SOH esitmation of lithium-ion batteries.

The file "fea_lab.pkl" is the voltage data.

The file "label_lab.pkl" is the capacity data.

The file "Model_save.pkl" is the trained model for loading directly.

The file "hyperparameters_save.mat" is the trained hyperparameters for loading directly.
